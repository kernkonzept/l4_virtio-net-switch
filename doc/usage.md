# Virtio Net Switch, a virtual network switch {#l4re_servers_vio_switch}

[comment]: # (This is a generated file. Do not change it.)
[comment]: # (Instead, change capdb.yml.)

The virtual network switch connects multiple clients with a virtual network
connection. It uses Virtio as the transport mechanism. Each virtual switch port
implements the host-side of a Virtio network device (virtio-net).


## Capabilities

* `dataspace`

  Trusted dataspaces

  Multiple capability names can be provided by the `--register-ds` command line
  parameter.

* `svr`

  Server Capability of application. Endpoint for IPC calls

  Mandatory capability.


## Command Line Options

In the example above the virtual network switch is started in its default
configuration with a maximum of 5 virtual ports. To customize the configuration
the virtual network switch accepts the following command line options:

* `-D <component=level>`, `--debug <component=level>`

  Configure individual debug levels per component. Verbosity increases from
  `quiet` up to `trace`.

  Can be used multiple times.

  Possible values for component are
  | `core`, `virtio`, `port`, `request`, `queue`, `packet`.

  Possible values for level are
  | `quiet`, `warn`, `info`, `debug`, `trace`.

* `-m`, `--mac`

  Ignored. Provided for compatibility with older switch versions.

  Flag. True if provided.

* `-M`

  Do not assign a random MAC address to ports by default. It is always possible
  to set an explicit MAC address by passing the `mac=` to the factory call,
  regardless of this option. If `-M` is passed and no `mac=` address was given,
  it is the responsibility of the Virtio driver to choose an appropriate
  address.

  Flag. True if provided.

* `-p <num>`, `--ports <num>`

  Set the maximum number of virtual ports.

  Numerical value.

  Default: `5`

* `-q`, `--quiet`

  Silence all output except for error messages.

  Flag. True if provided.

* `-s <num>`, `--size <num>`

  Set the maximum queue size for the device-side Virtio queues.

  Numerical value.
    * Must be a power of 2 in the range of 1 to 32768 inclusive.

  Default: `256`

* `-v`, `--verbose`

  Increase the global verbosity level. Individual levels per component can be
  set using the `-D` option.

  Can be used up to 3 times.

  Flag. True if provided.

* `-d <cap_name>`, `--register-ds <cap_name>`

  Register a trusted dataspace capability. If this option gets used, it is not
  possible to communicate with the server via dataspaces other than the
  registered ones. Can be used multiple times for multiple dataspaces.

  The option's parameter is the name of a dataspace capability.

  Can be used multiple times.

  Name of a provided capability that adheres to the dataspace protocol.

The virtual network switch can be setup to feature exactly one monitor port. All
traffic passing through the switch is mirrored to the monitor port. The monitor
port is read-only, and has no TX capability. An optional packet filter can be
configured and implemented to filter data sent to the monitor port.

## Configuration

Certain features of the virtual network switch are configurable at compile-time.
Configuration is done through the build-time configuration of the L4Re build
tree.

## Starting the service

The virtual network switch can be started in Ned like this:

```lua
local switch = L4.default_loader:new_channel();
L4.default_loader:start(
{
  caps = {
    svr = switch:svr(),
  },
},
"rom/l4vio_switch");
```

First a communication channel (`switch`) is created which is used to create
virtual network ports. It is connected to the switch component via its mandatory
`svr` capability. See the section below on how to create a new virtual port and
connect a client to it.

### Hardware devices
To plug hardware devices into the switch, provide a Vbus capability with the
name `vbus` when starting the switch. To use this feature, you have to enable
the `VNS_IXL` config option.

## Virtual switch port

First, a virtual network port has to be created using the following Ned-Lua
function. It has to be called on the communication channel called `switch`,
which has been created earlier.

Call:   `create(0 [, "ds-max=<max>", "name=<name>", "type=<port type>",
"vlan=(access=<vlan id>|trunk=<vlan id>[,<vlan id>]*)", "mac=<addr>"])`

* `"ds-max=<max>"`

  Specifies the upper limit of the number of dataspaces the client is allowed to
  register with the virtual network switch for Virtio DMA.

  Numerical value.
    * In the range of 1 to 80 inclusive

* `"name=<name>"`

  Sets the name of port in debug messages to `<name>`.  A name may consist of at
  most 19 characters, all other characters are dropped. If there is enough space
  left, the name will get a postfix of "[<port number>]", e.g. "name=foo" ->
  foo[1].

  String value.

* `"type=<port type>"`

  Optionally specify the port type.

  Possible values for `<port type>` are
    * `monitor`: Monitor Port
    * `normal`: Normal Port

  Default: `normal`

* `"vlan=(access=<vlan id>|trunk=<vlan id>[,<vlan id>]*)"`

  Configure the port to participate in an IEEE 802.1Q compatible VLAN.
  Fundamentally there are two types of ports: access ports and trunk ports.

  The Value for this parameter can be one of the following:

  * `"access=<vlan id>"`

    Configures the port as access port for VLAN `<vlan id>` where the id must be
    a decimal number greater than 0 and less than 4095 in accordance to the
    standard. Packets on an access port belong to the configured VLAN and are
    only forwarded to ports that belong to the same VLAN or trunk ports that
    participate in the particular VLAN. The packets on this port will not have a
    VLAN tag attached to them so that a guest connected to this port does not
    see that the port is part of a VLAN.

    An optional monitor port will see packets from an access port as VLAN tagged
    packets with the `<vlan id>` given for the port.

    Numerical value.
      * In the range of 0 to 4095 exclusive

  * `"trunk=<vlan id>[, <vlan id>]*"`

    Configures the port as trunk port. It participates either in all VLANs, if
    specified by the keyword 'all', or in the list of VLANs given as comma
    separated list. There must be no whitespace in the list. Each id must be a
    decimal number greater than 0 and less than 4095 in accordance to the
    standard. Outgoing packets on this port will be tagged with an IEEE 802.1Q
    compatible tag. Incoming packets must be tagged with a VLAN tag from the
    given list. Packets that have no tag or a tag not in the vlan id list are
    dropped silently. They are not forwarded to the monitor port either.
    Currently there is no support for IEEE 802.1p. The PCP and DEI sub-fields in
    the TCI field will be set to zero on outgoing packets and are ignored for
    incoming packets.

    Numerical value.

* `"mac=<addr>"`

  Explicitly sets the MAC address of the port. It will be checked that no other
  port on the switch has the same address. It is the responsibility of the user
  to ensure the validity of the address and its global uniqueness, though.

  String value.
    * In form xx:xx:xx:xx:xx:xx

If the `create()` call is successful a new capability which references a virtual
switch port is returned. A client uses this capability to talk to the virtual
network switch using the Virtio network protocol.



## Examples

Here are couple of examples on how to create ports with different properties:

```lua
-- normal port with at most 4 data spaces
net0 = switch:create(0, "ds-max=4")
-- like the previous but with name foo
net0 = switch:create(0, "ds-max=4", "name=foo")
-- like the previous but the port is a monitor port
net0 = switch:create(0, "ds-max=4", "name=foo", "type=monitor")
-- normal port with 4 data spaces as access port to VLAN 1
net0 = switch:create(0, "ds-max=4", "name=vl1", "vlan=access=1")
-- normal port with 4 data spaces as trunk port participating in VLAN 1 & 2
net0 = switch:create(0, "ds-max=4", "name=vl1", "vlan=trunk=1,2")
```
